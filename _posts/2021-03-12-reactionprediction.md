<p class="has-text-align-justify">We have all heard the following prophecies at least once during the last couple of years -- "Machines are going to replace humans in all the tasks that you could imagine?", "Artificial Intelligence is going to solve all the problems (but invent several others) that the human civilization currently suffers from!", and my personal favorite "You throw anything at the <em>ML software</em> and it will spit out the correct answer; it's like magic!" Though all of these (scandalous) statements have some truth in them, they are not at all useful for addressing the question that a non-ML scientist often has at the back of his mind -- could she be replaced as conveniently by algorithms as it is claimed so often?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The short answer to this is no, or in fact, I should say never! There could never be algorithms, no matter how complex or with how many billions of training parameters, that could <em>completely</em> replace an expert chemist. After all, the intelligence part of AI is still artificial, and the more you look into it, the more obvious is the realization that they are not even close to even fractionally mimicking the capabilities of the human mind. If this doesn't sound as convincing and would like to know the longer version of this, read on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Though the central question that I try to answer here is whether a human chemist could be replaced by machine learning-based systems, the same in my opinion applies to all the engineering and scientific disciplines. The premise for this post is based on our series of works where we build a chemistry-informed ML system that predicts the outcomes of organic chemical reactions -- both in the forward and the reverse (retrosynthesis) direction. There is no requirement of the chemist to perform any laboratory experiments whatsoever. The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348590373_Predicting_Chemical_Reaction_Outcomes_A_Grammar_Ontology-based_Transformer_Framework">article</a><sup>1</sup> describes this approach in much more technical detail than I would be covering in this post. If you or your institution does not have access to the journal, please reach out to me and I would be happy to share the full-text pdf version of the article.</p>

<h4>Organic chemical reactions</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Organic reactions are those that primarily involve organic compounds, consisting of molecules that are predominantly composed of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms, with the optional presence of certain other elements such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and so on. A vast majority of the compounds on earth are hydrocarbons with their vast abundance playing a significant role in global and local phenomena (climate change?). Such reactions often occur through a series of reactions that are highly dependent on the type of molecules under consideration and the reaction environment, often giving rise to extremely complex compounds in just a few steps. Moreover, the selectivity of the products changes significantly as the reaction conditions change. As a result of these factors, organic chemistry poses several challenges to anyone who attempts to use computational methods for modeling them. The difficulty increases several-fold if the underlying chemistry information is completely ignored. Here are two reactions that demonstrate how simple and complex organic reactions could become, depending on the participating compounds.</p>

<h4>Conventional reaction prediction approaches</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Conventionally, the majority of the reaction prediction work is guided by the existing reaction mechanisms that are known to chemists. These mechanisms are selected based on how a molecule gets manipulated based on the class of reactions that it might participate in across all the possibilities. Clearly, the process gets extremely complicated as more complex compounds are involved. To add to this, there is a dire shortage (relatively) of expert chemists in the scientific community who could devote their valuable time to sifting through all the possible chemical pathways to discover novel reactions. Rather, they are more dependent on their experience, chemistry knowledge, and intuition that guides them in the right direction. However, wouldn't it be beneficial for the entire scientific community if there were a helping hand in the form of a computational tool that could do most of the work and level the creative aspects of the task to the chemist?</p>

<p>Again, machine learning to the rescue! </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Isn't it amazing as to how apparently useful they seem to be, yet we all despise them because of their lack of transparency from a human's perspective? Isn't this our limitation to understand the systems that work so well and make predictions on data points outside the training set as well with a fairly high degree of accuracy? I'll defer this discussion to a later post and stick to the reaction prediction problem in the interest of the attention deficit of most readers.</p>

<h4>Machine translation and reaction prediction</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Our motivation to use a machine translation approaches to the reaction prediction framework came into existence because of the stark similarities between the natural language that we use to communicate in our daily lives and the language of chemistry that the chemists use in their daily lives (in addition to natural language, of course!). Just as natural language has sentences and words as the atomic units in a sentence that convey a given meaning, the language of chemistry analogously has molecular representations (H2O, CO2, C2H5OH) with the individual characters being the atomic units that convey information on the constituent elements and their stoichiometry. Thus, using a machine translation framework made complete sense and we hypothesized that this would open a new direction in chemistry.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mannpravachan.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/translation.png"><img src="https://mannpravachan.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/translation.png?w=500" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="793" height="271"/></a><figcaption>Figure 3: Modeling a chemical reaction prediction task as a machine translation problem.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The next question was how do we incorporate chemistry knowledge in the system? We again turned to the analogy between natural language and chemistry to look for an answer. Quickly, the natural extension of the natural language analogy seemed to be the grammatical or syntactical structure of natural language sentences -- grammatical rules that formalize the construction of sentences (molecular representations) from their respective atomic units. All the existing works in the area of reaction prediction have ignored this stark analogy that fundamentally defines the structure of the high-level constructs from the lower-level units. We hypothesized that the inclusion of such information in the machine translation frameworks would significantly aid the model in <em>learning</em> the grammar, instead of hoping it to learn (or memorize) it based on the training set. Moreover, such a grammar-based framework would ensure that the predictions made using such a framework would be highly likely to follow the grammar-rules themselves and therefore be syntactically correct, i.e. water is more likely to be predicted as H2O instead of 2HO or OH2, though all of them have the same stoichiometry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The grammar rules for natural language and for a text-based representation of molecules (SMILES notation) are shown in the following figure and the stark contrasts between the non-grammatical and grammatical representations seem obvious. The molecular formula-based representations C3H6 contains the least amount of chemical information and hence, is out of the question when considering representations for use in complex matching learning architectures.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mannpravachan.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/grammartree.jpeg"><img src="https://mannpravachan.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/grammartree.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-179" width="580" height="435"/></a><figcaption>Figure 4: The parse‐tree obtained for propene with the simplified molecular‐input line‐entry system (SMILES) representation as&nbsp;CC=C&nbsp;using the representative grammar in Table&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.17190">1</a>. The sequence of production rule indices obtained while parsing the above tree corresponds to the grammar representation and is given as 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 15, 17, 6, 15, 17, 13, 6, 15, 17. Image from Mann, V. and Venkatasubramanian, V. (2021), Predicting chemical reaction outcomes: A grammar ontology‐based transformer framework.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">We, therefore, proposed these newer representations that incorporate the underlying structure. Without going too much into technical details, imagine that each of the text-based representations is obtained by following a set of grammatical rules that are applied sequentially to obtain the corresponding tokens. These rules and their sequential application could be represented using a tree as shown above. The grammar production rules are extracted from these trees by parsing them in the indicated manner, which now becomes the new representations that incorporate all the additional structural and grammatical information underlying the molecule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Our approach gave promising results. For over 80% of the unseen reactions, the model resulted in an exact match with the correct product of the reaction. Moreover, of all the predictions on the test dataset, 99% of the predictions were syntactically correct, indicating that our model learned the underlying SMILES grammar, similar to a person learning the grammatical constructs of the English language to ensure she forms grammatically correct sentences. Further analysis revealed that the average similarity of all the predictions was over 95%, meaning that even the incorrect predictions were very close to the ground truth and differ only by a small mismatch. Finally, true to the spirit of this post, we compared the performance against human organic chemists and the results were surprising yet again -- his model beat them across all the reaction types. The following figures show the comparison and the incorrect predictions that were still very close to the ground truth. </p>

<h4>What does this mean?</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Coming back to the same question -- does the rapid development and improvement of such systems eventually replace the human experts and obviate the years of hard-earned experience? Certainly not! At best, such systems would aid an expert chemist in making faster (and possibly better?) decisions by cutting-short the experimentation cycle and serving merely as 'suggestions-providing system'. There is however a lot of optimism around building such automated chemistry modeling and prediction systems with a many leading corporation betting big on this. But would anyone prefer completely relying on such systems and getting rid of all the chemists? Could we get rid of all the chemistry textbooks and just treat chemistry as yet another data-rich field like computer vision or robotics? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The answer to this would really be clear when we consider the following question -- would you take a vaccine that is  completely designed using ML algorithms, with little to no involvement of human experts, but seems promising on  possible data-driven metrics? Even if the test-set accuracy is nearly perfect, would you share the same confidence that of the data scientists who designed the model? That really is the litmus test, in my opinion, for determining whether we are the stage of replacing chemists and chemistry with AI models. At present, we are (really) far from it! </p>
